//We will receive an error message because the variable foo
//was called outside the scope from which it was created.

//4. 
//The messages that greet Victor will print but we will
//receive an error message when we try to assign 'Joe'
//to NAME because values for constants can't be changed.

//5.
//The string 'bar' is logged. The second foo variable
//declared is in a block, making it invisible to the 
//console.log command, whereas the first foo variable 
//declared is within the same scope as the log command.

//6.
//No. If we tried to declare a second constant named FOO
//in the same scope as our first constant named FOO, then
//we would encounter an error. However, declaring FOO in
//a block means our two constants have different scopes
//and therefore do not conflict with one another.
